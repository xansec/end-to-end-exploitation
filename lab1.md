Examine /exploit/labs/rewrite_nitf.py. This script has multiple functions which will walk us through applying the techniques from the slides to our target.
Completing each lab will result in an output file <lab#.nitf>. Each file can be used to debug the execution of extract75 for the next lab.
Set the value of FILESTART to 0x16b.
Now you are ready to start Lab 1.
Examine lab1_numi().  There are a number of TODO comments next to variables which will need to be defined.
Use gdb and the /exploit/crasher/531â€¦ file to locate the correct values.
Hint: info addr <varname> is a useful gdb command.
