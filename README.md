# End-to-End Binary Exploitation Training

## Course Description

This is another installment of the binary exploitation series of trainings.

You will learn with how to use the Global Offset Table to exploit a vulnerability discovered with Mayhem.

Weâ€™re excited to have you join us.  We hope you take away even more new
fuzzing skills. But moreso, we also hope you come away with a passion for making
application security more autonomous.

## Agenda

In this course, we will learn more about exploiting binaries with test cases found using Mayhem. 
At the end of the training, you will be able to:

1. Explain What Fuzz Testing Is
2. Explain what a "Write-What-Where" vulnerability is
3. Inspect the assembly code of your own binaries
4. Analyze a target using Mayhem
5. Exploit the target using a generated crash file
