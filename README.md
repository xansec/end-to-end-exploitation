# End-to-End Binary Exploitation Training

## Course Description

This is another installment of the binary exploitation series of trainings.

You will learn with how to use the Global Offset Table to exploit a vulnerability discovered with Mayhem.

Weâ€™re excited to have you join us.  We hope you take away even more new
fuzzing skills. But moreso, we also hope you come away with a passion for making
application security more autonomous.

## Agenda

In this course, we will learn more about exploiting binaries with test cases found using Mayhem.
At the end of the training, you will be able to:

1. Explain What Fuzz Testing Is
2. Explain what a "Write-What-Where" vulnerability is
3. Inspect the assembly code of your own binaries
4. Analyze a target using Mayhem
5. Exploit the target using a generated crash file

## Prerequisites

You'll need the following packages installed:

```
python3 gdb curl wget build-essential automake autoconf cmake procps binutils gcc-multilib git unzip
```

You'll also need to disable ASLR for the demo.

```
sysctl kernel.randomize_va_space=0
```

If you want it to persist across reboots:

```
touch /etc/sysctl.d/01-disable-aslr.conf
echo "kernel.randomize_va_space = 0">/etc/sysctl.d/01-disable-aslr.conf
```

You'll also need to install GEF:

```
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://gef.blah.cat/sh)"
gdb -q
```

Finally, make sure you have Mayhem installed:

```
# Linux CLI
curl --fail -L https://app.mayhem.security/cli/Linux/install.sh | sh

# MacOS CLI
curl --fail -L https://app.mayhem.security/cli/Darwin/install.sh | sh
```
