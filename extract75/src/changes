Program and File Changes

Version 7.5
    Fixed errant error message (find_text_tag: Error finding end of tag)

Version 7.4
    Added new data field formats for .dff/.pff files.  New fields are:
    S = signed ints
    U = unsigned ints
    F = floating point

Version 7.3
    Added option to allow extract to dump the text of unknown TREs to files.
    Also mapped TRE named "?????" to badname1

Version 7.2
    Made extract smart enough to differentiate between Airborne v0.9a TREs
        and v1.0draft TREs, and use the proper set
    Changed dff/pff file field widths to allow field width of 0
    Created extract to Phoenix file using TREs as meta-data (-p_tre)
    Began adding internal support for ENGRDA Engineering Support Data Extension

Version 7.1
    Public distribution of GUI front-end (extract.tcl)
    Updated installation and user documentation for GUI front-end
    Fixed a problem with TRE extraction when a TRE field (representing a
        number) contains a NULL character
    Made several changes to compile under Visual C++ 6.0:
        Changed BORLAND definition to PC
        moved the sleep() call inside the BORLAND section
    Removed some status messages, added a few casts to remove some warnings

Version 7.0
    Added more options for use with the GUI interface
    Added -standard option to extract files using standard file names like
        image#.raw image#.jpg image#.dat text_seg#.txt
    Added better error checking for parsing of TREs

Version 6.9
    Added option for use with GUI interface

Version 6.8
    Fixed a bug to handle the case when NITF filename fields are empty
        (all spaces)

Version 6.7
    Fixed TRE extraction: Previous version didn't append loop counters.
    Fixed Phoenix output for signed/unsigned integers, number of integer bits
    Fixed to extract 12 bit integer data

Version 6.6
    Changed .dff/.pff file format
        After the field size, you can add units (in double-quotes), and a
        conversion function (also in double-quotes).  If a conversion function
        is needed without units, add two double-quotes to hold the units field.

    Implemented conversion functions:
        m2ft    Meters to feet
        ft2m    Feet to meters

Version 6.5
    Updated the program usage text
    Added the -p_tre flag (Dump data and TRE contents to Phoenix file)

Version 6.4
    Added -text_only command line argument
    Added -jpeg_only command line argument
    A few fixes

Version 6.3
    Added -g switch to create a .geo file for each image section with
        an IGEOLO

    Added -qpm switch to extract data in Quarter Power Magnitude
        format.  Same as taking the square root of each data value before
        writing it.  Suggested use is with -mag_only (magnitude only) switch.

Version 6.2a,b
    Fixes:
        -ssummary
        Security "downgrading event" field handling

Version 6.2
    Added "-ssummary filename" option to dump NITF S-type summary
        information to an output file.
        One line of information is dumped per image in an NITF file,
        appended to the output file.  The first line of the file shows the
        output line format, many terms are NITF image subheader labels.  No
        other files are created in the process for speed.  Very limited
        IGEOLO support.

Version 6.1
    Enabled extract to differentiate between (draft 25-sept-1997) and
        version 1.0 draft BANDSA TRE (bandsa0.dff is the older version,
        bandsa1.dff is version 1.0 draft)

    Fixes

Version 6.0
    Fixed extract for DDB NITF 2.0 files

Version 5.9
    Fixed TRE extraction for TREs attached to the NITF main header
        (finally got test data!)
    Added clctnb.dff file

Version 5.8
    Fixed the magnitude-only option to adjust the meta-data attributes
        for magnitude-only data (DataType, DataSize, removed DataCheckSum).

    Improved TRE filename number incrementing.  NITF header dump files
        will no longer auto-increment the filename if a NITF file is extracted
        multiple times to the same output directory.

Version 5.7
    Added TRE extraction for the NITF main header
    Added support for 2 or more of the same TRE in a section (by changing last
        digit of filename)

    Added TRE extraction for extended subheader data areas
    Added #DESs and #RESs to the menu
    Added dump of NITF 2.0 Main file header
    Added Whenever TREs are extracted, image information files will be
        created as well.

Version 5.6
    Added option to extract magnitude data only for SAR
        (magnitude/phase)

    Fixed a few bugs
    Added image number to end of TRE filenames so the files would be
        unique

    Better TRE (Tagged Record Extension) extraction capability
        Added more .dff (TRE definition format file) files
        .dff filenames now all lower case for UNIX
        Skips TRE (instead of halting) if .dff file isn't available.

Version 5.5
    Fixed unblocking routine for blocked 16 bit integer and blocked 32
    bit floating point data.

Version 5.4
    Not released.

Version 5.3
    Fixed problems with extracting NITF 2.0 files.
    Added version numbers to .dff (TRE definition) files.

Version 5.2.1
    No changes to source code
    Fixed problems with the TRE .dff (Definition) files.  Loop lengths
    were off in some cases.  Only affects people who extract the Research
    TREs (Tagged Record Extensions).

Version 5.2
    Added command line and menu options to dump TREs to files.  Added
    ability to dump TREs to files (Current TREs:   VISMAS BANDSA, Research
    TREs version 0.5: CLCTNA, IMGDTA, OBJCTA, PLTFMA, SNSRA, TRGTA).

Version 5.0
    All extracts dump the NITF and image headers (nitf_2N_main.txt,
    image_hdrN.txt)
