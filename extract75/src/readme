 *******************************************************************************
 *
 * !!  IMPORTANT  !!  IMPORTANT  !!  IMPORTANT  !!  IMPORTANT  !!  IMPORTANT !!
 *
 * After compiling this software, set the environment variable DFFPATH to the
 * full pathname where the .dff files are.  Extract needs to be able to find
 * these files.
 *
 *******************************************************************************
 *
 *      Extract - files from NITF 2.0 or 2.1 data distribution files
 *
 * This program extracts the image data files, JPEG files, and most text
 * segments from NITF 2.0 and 2.1 input files.
 *
 *******************************************************************************
 *
 * EXECUTABLE OR SOURCE CODE UPDATES:
 *
 * This software can be found on a password restricted website.
 * You will need an account for the website to access it.
 *
 * (For questions, E-Mail sdms_help@mbvlab.wpafb.af.mil)
 *
 * To check for new versions of this software, go to:
 *
 *    https://www.mbvlab.wpafb.af.mil/sdms/tools/index.htm
 *
 * The software is under DDB Tools
 *******************************************************************************
 *
 * MAKING THE EXTRACT EXECUTABLE
 *
 * UNIX
 * Use the included makefile.  You might have to change the CC= line to gcc,
 * g++, CC, cc, or whatever compiler you have.  This program should compile
 * using an ANSI C or C++ compiler.
 *
 * PC
 * Make sure "PC" is defined.  This is necessary for byte swapping, correct
 * include files, etc.
 *
 * Set up your development environment to use Win32 and
 * console output.  Next, add all the C files, compile, and link.
 *
 * If you want to compile from the command line, modify the included makefile.
 *
 *******************************************************************************
 *
 * PROGRAM NOTES:
 * 1) Extract is still under development, and changes are made to it every
 *    week.  New releases will be put on the web as necessary to extract new
 *    types of data being distributed, or for bug fixes and improvements.
 *
 * 2) Image and Text segments are written to the name given in their title
 *    field for Veridian DDB data distributions.
 *
 * 3) Some NITF text segments are for the internal
 *    use of this extract program, and aren't written.  These text segments
 *    contain a line like "<Veridian....>".
 *
 * 4) Text segments are written with linefeeds for end-of-lines.
 *
 * 5) DESs, labels, and symbols are read from an NITF file if they exist.
 *    Label, symbol, and graphic segments are written out as files.
 *
 * 6) Data image unblocking is done in most cases.  If image data is not
 *    unblocked, a message will be printed to the screen.  All DDB data
 *    distributed by Veridian at this time is properly unblocked on extract.
 *
 * 7) If you are going to integrate this code into your software:
 *    o Keep in mind this code is under active development, and changes often.
 *      New updates are posted on the web periodically.  New types of data
 *      we distribute may not work with this code or may break this code.
 *    o To find out what is different for each update of this source code, use
 *      a source code comparison tool like diff, and compare the new against the
 *      old, file by file.
 *    o Download, print, read, and understand NITF 2.0 and 2.1  Copies are at:
 *      164.214.2.51/ntb/ntb_docs/status.html#baseline
 *      Download Mil Std 2500A(2) and 2500B.
 *    o The program flow is to read the entire NITF file, present a text menu if
 *      desired, then write all output files using the user's options.

 ******************************************************************************


Version 7.1
    Public distribution of GUI front-end (extract.tcl)
    Updated installation and user documentation for GUI front-end
    Fixed a problem with TRE extraction when a TRE field (representing a
    	number) contains a NULL character
    Made several changes to compile under Visual C++ 6.0:
    	Changed BORLAND definition to PC
    	moved the sleep() call inside the BORLAND section
    Removed some status messages, added a few casts to remove some warnings

Version 7.0
    Added more options for use with the GUI interface
    Added -standard option to extract files using standard file names like
        image#.raw image#.jpg image#.dat text_seg#.txt
    Added better error checking for parsing of TREs

Version 6.9
    Added option for use with GUI interface

Version 6.8
    Fixed a bug to handle the case when NITF filename fields are empty
        (all spaces)

Version 6.7
    Fixed TRE extraction: Previous version didn't append loop counters.
    Fixed Phoenix output for signed/unsigned integers, number of integer bits
    Fixed to extract 12 bit integer data

Version 6.6
    Changed .dff/.pff file format
        After the field size, you can add units (in double-quotes), and a
        conversion function (also in double-quotes).  If a conversion function
        is needed without units, add two double-quotes to hold the units field.

    Implemented conversion functions:
        m2ft    Meters to feet
        ft2m    Feet to meters

Version 6.5
    Updated the program usage text
    Added the -p_tre flag (Dump data and TRE contents to Phoenix file)

Version 6.4
    Added -text_only command line argument
    Added -jpeg_only command line argument
    A few fixes

Version 6.3
    Added -g switch to create a .geo file for each image section with
        an IGEOLO

    Added -qpm switch to extract data in Quarter Power Magnitude
        format.  Same as taking the square root of each data value before
        writing it.  Suggested use is with -mag_only (magnitude only) switch.

Version 6.2a,b
    Fixes:
        -ssummary
        Security "downgrading event" field handling

Version 6.2
    Added "-ssummary filename" option to dump NITF S-type summary
        information to an output file.
        One line of information is dumped per image in an NITF file,
        appended to the output file.  The first line of the file shows the
        output line format, many terms are NITF image subheader labels.  No
        other files are created in the process for speed.  Very limited
        IGEOLO support.

Version 6.1
    Enabled extract to differentiate between (draft 25-sept-1997) and
        version 1.0 draft BANDSA TRE (bandsa0.dff is the older version,
        bandsa1.dff is version 1.0 draft)

    Fixes

Version 6.0
    Fixed extract for DDB NITF 2.0 files

Version 5.9
    Fixed TRE extraction for TREs attached to the NITF main header
        (finally got test data!)
    Added clctnb.dff file

Version 5.8
    Fixed the magnitude-only option to adjust the meta-data attributes
        for magnitude-only data (DataType, DataSize, removed DataCheckSum).

    Improved TRE filename number incrementing.  NITF header dump files
        will no longer auto-increment the filename if a NITF file is extracted
        multiple times to the same output directory.

Version 5.7
    Added TRE extraction for the NITF main header
    Added support for 2 or more of the same TRE in a section (by changing last
        digit of filename)

    Added TRE extraction for extended subheader data areas
    Added #DESs and #RESs to the menu
    Added dump of NITF 2.0 Main file header
    Added Whenever TREs are extracted, image information files will be
        created as well.

Version 5.6
    Added option to extract magnitude data only for SAR
        (magnitude/phase)

    Fixed a few bugs
    Added image number to end of TRE filenames so the files would be
        unique

    Better TRE (Tagged Record Extension) extraction capability
        Added more .dff (TRE definition format file) files
        .dff filenames now all lower case for UNIX
        Skips TRE (instead of halting) if .dff file isn't available.

Version 5.5
    Fixed unblocking routine for blocked 16 bit integer and blocked 32
    bit floating point data.

Version 5.4
    Not released.

Version 5.3
    Fixed problems with extracting NITF 2.0 files.
    Added version numbers to .dff (TRE definition) files.

Version 5.2.1
    No changes to source code
    Fixed problems with the TRE .dff (Definition) files.  Loop lengths
    were off in some cases.  Only affects people who extract the Research
    TREs (Tagged Record Extensions).

Version 5.2
    Added command line and menu options to dump TREs to files.  Added
    ability to dump TREs to files (Current TREs:   VISMAS BANDSA, Research
    TREs version 0.5: CLCTNA, IMGDTA, OBJCTA, PLTFMA, SNSRA, TRGTA).

Version 5.0
    All extracts dump the NITF and image headers (nitf_2N_main.txt,
    image_hdrN.txt)
