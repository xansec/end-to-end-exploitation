NITF 2.1/2.0 File Parser (NITF Extract) Installation Guide


Introduction

    NITF Extract Tool

    To ease the transition to the new image/data format a utility has
    been developed to parse the NITF file into just sensor data and
    metadata files. In addition, the utility will convert MBVLAB NITF
    2.1 files into a format similar to the previous "Phoenix" file
    format. This document describes the installation of this NITF
    parser/extract utility. For more information on using the NITF
    parser/extract utility, please reference the Users Manual.

    Why NITF 2.1?

    In an effort to increase inter-program data sharing, we are
    striving for a standard file format for sensor data. The National
    Image Transmission Format (NITF) version 2.1 was selected. NITF
    combines image/sensor data and metadata about the image/sensor
    data into one widely accepted file format. NITF version 2.1
    (approved in September, 1998) has several new key features that
    were required. These include: Y2K compliance, new expanded
    security fields, non-displayable data types, and support for
    floating-point data, complex data, and up to 999 bands.


New Graphic User Interface (GUI)

    Extract, version 7.1 and newer, come with a graphic user interface
    for ease of use.  The user interface will let you interactively
    select an NITF file, see a table of contents, set extract options,
    and extract to the directory you select.

    The graphic user interface is a separate program that runs the command line
    extract program to do its work.  The GUI runs on MS Windows, Linux, and
    most UNIX computers.  The GUI requires the (free) Tcl/Tk package, version
    8.0 or newer.  This document has instructions for obtaining and installing
    Tcl/Tk.


Installing NITF Extract:

    1. download the NITF extract tar file(s)
    2. check whether your system has Tcl/Tk running on it
    3. obtain and install Tcl/Tk if necessary
    4. finish installing NITF Extract and GUI.

    These steps are presented in order as you follow this document.


Check whether your system has Tcl/Tk 8.0 or newer running on it:
    Windows
        Run the find command.  Search for a file named wish on all your local
        hard drives.  If you find a shortcut icon or an icon like wish8.1,
        double-click it.  Type "echo $tk_version" in the console window.  If the
        version is 8.0 or newer, you don't need a new version.

    Linux
        You probably already have Tcl/Tk installed.  Look in /usr/local/bin for
        wish or wish#.#  If you find the entry, type wish on the command line.
        Type echo $tk_version  If the version is 8.0 or newer, you don't need a
	new version.

    UNIX
        Look in /usr/local/bin for wish or wish#.#  If you find the entry, type
	wish from the command line.  Type echo $tk_version If the version is 8.0
	or newer, you don't need a new version.


Download Tcl/Tk (For NITF Extract GUI):

    Windows:
    -------
    http://dev.scriptics.com/products/tcltk/download83.html
    or http://dev.scriptics.com/ and find and download Tck/Tk


    Linux:
    -----
    If Tcl/Tk isn't installed, install it from your distribution disks or
    follow the directions for UNIX, below.


    UNIX Versions:
    -------------
    Our system administrator recommends that you download the source
    code and build it for your machine.  One advantage of this is you can
    build your own private copy of Tcl/Tk if your system administrator is
    too busy.


    To download source code to build Tcl/Tk:
    http://dev.scriptics.com/products/tcltk/download83.html


    To download a pre-built version for your version of UNIX:
    http://dev.scriptics.com/resource/software/ports/



Tcl/Tk Installation (For NITF Extract GUI):

    Windows:
    -------
    Run the tcl8xx.exe file, and follow the prompts.  Tcl/Tk will be installed
    for you.


    UNIX/Linux:
    ----------

    If more than one person uses the machine, get your system
    administrator to install Tcl/Tk.  This way, it can be used by
    everyone.

    To compile, these directions should help:
    http://dev.scriptics.com/services/support/howto/compile.html

    To install a pre-built version, follow the instructions you get
    with the downloaded files.



Install the NITF Extract Tools:

    1) Create a directory for the NITF Extract software and data files.

    2) Unzip or untar the files into that directory.

    This set of files includes executable files or source code for
    your system. To compile the parser/extract source code, any ANSI-
    compatible C or C++ compiler may be used.


    3) Platform-specific setup


        Windows 95/98:
        -------------
        Make a shortcut to extract.tcl (the GUI user-interface), and put it in
	your menu or on your desktop

        Set up these environment variables:

        DFFPATH             Full path where the data files (*.dff)
                            reside.

        nitf_extract_path   Full path where the NITF Extract program
                            resides.

        nitf_extract_exe    Full path and filename of the NITF Extract
                            program (Must be version 7.1 or newer)


        To set these variables, edit the c:\autoexec.bat file, and add
        lines like:


        set DFFPATH=c:\extract
        set nitf_extract_path=c:\extract_dir
        set nitf_extract_exe=c:\extract_dir\extract71.exe

        * Do not put any spaces left or right of the equal sign.



        Windows NT:
        ----------
        Make a shortcut to extract.tcl (the GUI user-interface), and put it in
	your menu or on your desktop

        You need to set up environment variables.  Open My Computer, then
	Control Panel, then System.  Click on the Environment tab.  Click in
	the System Variables listbox to tell the system you want to add an
	environment variable for all users of your computer.  Enter these
	variables and values, clicking the set button after each variable /
	value pair.


	Variable            Value
        --------            -----

        DFFPATH             Full path where the NITF Extract *.dff
                            files reside.

        nitf_extract_path   Full path where the NITF Extract program
                            resides.

        nitf_extract_exe    Full path and filename of the NITF Extract
                            program (Must be version 7.1 or newer)



        UNIX/Linux Part I
        -----------------

        You need to set up these environment variables:

        DFFPATH             Full path where the NITF Extract *.dff
                            files reside.

        nitf_extract_path   Full path where the NITF Extract program
                            resides.

        nitf_extract_exe    Full path and filename of the NITF Extract
                            program (Must be version 7.1 or newer)


        Add these environment variables to your login script file, like
        this example for the typical C-shell file (.cshrc):

        setenv DFFPATH /user/people/me/extract_dir
        setenv nitf_extract_path /user/people/me/extract_dir
        setenv nitf_extract_exe /user/people/me/extract_dir/extract71

	You will probably want to add the extract directory to your path for
	convenience (csh .cshrc): set path=( $path /usr/people/me/extract_dir )

	Open a new shell and test your setup by running extract.tcl
	If you get library errors, go to Part II



        UNIX/Linux Part II (Fixing Library errors)
        ------------------------------------------

        You need to check and maybe add the Tcl/Tk path and library
        variables to your login script file.

        Here's an example for the typical C-shell login:
        (Example for tcl installed at /home/username/tcl)


        setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /usr/lib:/usr/openwin/lib:/home/usernam
        e/tcl/lib

        set path = (/home/username/tcl/bin $path)


        * Note: to set the library path, check the previous value of
        LD_LIBRARY_PATH (printenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH), and add the tcl
        library path (separate with a colon)

        * Find out where your system administrator installed Tcl/Tk,
        and use that. It is usually put in /usr/local/bin
