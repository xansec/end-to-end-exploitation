Revisit the rewrite_nitf.py and examine lab4_shellcode().
Select a shellcode from https://shell-storm.org/shellcode/index.html
Simple is better. 
Match your shellcode location to the jump target you wrote to the GOT in Lab 4.
Test it out! Running extract75 lab4.nitf should result in execution of your shellcode.
