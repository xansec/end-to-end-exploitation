# Lab 2: What Where

## Overview

Examine [rewrite_nitf.py](rewrite_nitf.py). This script has multiple functions which will walk us through applying techniques to our target.
Completing each lab will result in an output file <lab#.nitf>. Each file can be used to debug the execution of extract75 for the next lab.
Set the value of FILESTART to 0x16b.
Now you are ready to start.

**Time to complete**: About 15 minutes

# lab3_what_where()
Examine lab3_what_where().
Use gdb and the lab2.nitf file to locate the correct values.
_Hint:_  How do we account for the struct offset of the second write target?
_Hint:_  How many bytes are we skipping for the second `strncpy`? Remember it is targeting the `length_of_data` field in the struct.
