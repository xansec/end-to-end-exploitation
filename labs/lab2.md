# Lab 2: Where

## Overview

Examine [rewrite_nitf.py](rewrite_nitf.py). This script has multiple functions which will walk us through applying techniques to our target.
Completing each lab will result in an output file <lab#.nitf>. Each file can be used to debug the execution of extract75 for the next lab.
Set the value of FILESTART to 0x16b.
Now you are ready to start.

**Time to complete**: About 15 minutes

## lab2_where()

Examine lab2_where(). As in Lab 1, youâ€™ll need to set the addresses for the variables of interest.
Use gdb and the lab1.nitf file to locate the correct values.
_Hint:_ The gdb/gef got command will help you pick a target.
_Hint:_ Pay attention to the endianness of the byte string.
