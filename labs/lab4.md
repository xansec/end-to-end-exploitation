# Lab 4: Injecting Shellcode

## Overview

Examine [rewrite_nitf.py](rewrite_nitf.py). This script has multiple functions which will walk us through applying techniques to our target.
Completing each lab will result in an output file <lab#.nitf>. Each file can be used to debug the execution of extract75 for the next lab.
Set the value of FILESTART to 0x16b.
Now you are ready to start.

**Time to complete**: About 15 minutes

## lab4_shellcode()

Revisit the rewrite_nitf.py and examine lab4_shellcode().
1. Select a shellcode from https://shell-storm.org/shellcode/index.html. Simple is better.
2. Match your shellcode location to the jump target you wrote to the GOT in Lab 4.
3. Test it out! Running extract75 lab4.nitf should result in execution of your shellcode.
