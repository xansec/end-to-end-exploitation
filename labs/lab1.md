# Lab 1: Number_of_Images

## Overview

Examine [rewrite_nitf.py](rewrite_nitf.py). This script has multiple functions which will walk us through applying techniques to our target.
Completing each lab will result in an output file <lab#.nitf>. Each file can be used to debug the execution of extract75 for the next lab.
Set the value of FILESTART to 0x16b.
Now you are ready to start.

**Time to complete**: About 15 minutes

## lab1_numi()

Examine lab1_numi().  There are a number of TODO comments next to variables which will need to be defined.
Use gdb and the `/mayhem/defects/5315fb378c56843434354a742b47e0c42fb8f7f82cde45c2156acbe7a7bd3a66531` file to locate the correct values.
_Hint:_  `info addr <varname>` is a useful gdb command.
