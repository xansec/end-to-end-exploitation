# How to use

For this training, I'm using Okteta as hex editor. This requires that
some structure definitions for the NITF file type are provided in order to
properly inspect the hex. I have provided the proper installation files in this
directory. To install:

1. Run `mkdir /usr/share/okteta/structures/nitf`
2. Run `cp ./nitf-structs.desktop /usr/share/okteta/structures/nitf`
3. Run `cp ./main.js /usr/share/okteta/structures/nitf`
